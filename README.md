# ListPerf
Simple benchmarking example, based on a [_Stackoverflow_ question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/50848436/2593574).

To execute the benchmark, you'll need to have [_SBT_](https://scala-sbt.org/) installed. Then enter the following
command:

```
sbt test
```

The results are expressed in milliseconds.
